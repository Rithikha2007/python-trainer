Maya wants to know how the Numbers are converted to string in the program.could you please help her to implements the program.

Input Format

input consists of one integer
Constraints

Given N is greater than 0 and lesser than 9
Output Format

print the number into string type.
Sample Input 0

0
Sample Output 0

Integer is 0 and String is Zero

output:

# Read input
n = int(input())

# Dictionary for number to string mapping
num_to_str = {
    0: "Zero",
    1: "One",
    2: "Two",
    3: "Three",
    4: "Four",
    5: "Five",
    6: "Six",
    7: "Seven",
    8: "Eight",
    9: "Nine"
}

# Check constraints and print output
if 0 <= n <= 9:
    print(f"Integer is {n} and String is {num_to_str[n]}")
else:
    print("Invalid Input")
